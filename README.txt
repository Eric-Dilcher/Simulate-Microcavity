This python program calculates the reflection and transmission coefficients of a microcavity (also called a Bragg stack) according to the "transfer matrix" method outlined in "Introduction to Optics" by Pedrotti.

You must install the configobj library for python.  Adjust config.ini to customize the simulation. Run "main_microcavity.py" to run simulation.
